  <h3>Learning vs Development</h3>
  <p class='citation'>Vygotsky, Lev S. “Mind and Society.” <i>Harvard University Press</i>, 1930, pp. 8–17.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have always liked math, it is useful, it comes easily to me and when I was younger, being good at it would gain a lot of praise. In elementary school the classes came easily so I was pushed into extracurriculars. I competed in math competitions from the third grade to the sixth grade. Once I had finished with the competitions I wanted to get ahead in math, not because there was some goal to attain or because I really loved math but because I thought people would find it impressive. During the summer of sixth grade I took a math class to become one grade ahead and studied at home for the next class to become two grades ahead. After doing so I had made a plan to get to Calculus 1 by my freshman year in highschool.

    Spoiler alert: it didn’t happen.

    When I hit the 8th grade I was hit by major depression and the transition from computationally centered math classes to classes which required memorization of theorems and postulates to solve proofs did not come naturally to me. I was used to math simply coming easily and I had not developed the necessary study skills to get past this change in math. Quite like Vygotsky says,

      Although learning is directly related to the course of child development, the two are never accomplished in equal measure or in parallel. Development in children never follows school learning the way a shadow follows the object that casts it. In actuality, there are highly complex dynamic relations between developmental and learning processes that cannot be encompassed by unchanging hypothetical formulation. (Vygotsky, 17)
    </p>

  <p>
    I had done the prerequisite learning but not the development. This caused me to lose self esteem and give up on math from the 8th grade until college. At which point I had to restart from two grades lower than I had begun because of the college’s placement process.

    My transcript had me placed into Math 64. Luckily I had time to study and take a placement exam which allowed me to skip Math 64, 126 and 131 to go to 150. Within two years I had taken all 150, 155, 226, 260, 265 and 270. Now that it was 5 years later, I had developed enough to make up for my past shortcomings and could now progress further as I was no longer depressed and the classes were within my zone of proximal development.

  <h3>Styles of Learning</h3>
  <p class="citation">Freire, Paulo “Pedagogy of the Oppressed.” <i>30th Anniversary Edition</i>, 2005, pp. 72–86.</p>

  <p>
    When I first transferred to Berkeley I was interested in the difference in how Cal structured its courses. Instead of the normal pure lecture then test style of class, my computer science classes employed Lecture → Discussion → Lab classes. Though they are not perfect, I found that this style of class was superior to the classic pure lecture style. Instead of education just being depositing, we first deposit, discuss then apply in lab.
  </p>

  <div class="quote">
    <p>Education thus becomes an act of depositing, in which the students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor. (Freire, 72)</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Of course, this is an educational literacy is transferable to all types of learning. In my last year at Cal I joined Cal's competitive boxing team and we follow the Lecture, Discussion and Lab approach. We train for three hours a day and always begin by stretching and warming up while Coach Jon lectures extensively on what we will be learning. Whether it is slipping punches, footwork, changing levels or even just fitness related, Coach goes in depth on what we are focusing on today and how our the exercises and drills apply. We then do either partner contact drills or begin slowly with limited sparring. Applying what Coach has told us as he walks around the group and gives feedback, reminding us of what he had previously lectured on. We then end with full speed sparring, being judged on our application of today's focus. This acts as a laboratory style learning, putting what we are learning to use in a real time stressful enviornment. Finally we gather around in a circle and discuss. Each team member says at least one thing that worked for them and one thing they noticed another team mate did in drills or sparring that was good or bad.

    <p>Liberating education consists in acts of cognition, not transferrals of information (Freire, 79).</p>

    I think my coaches style of teaching exemplifies some of what Freire was trying to convey through his explanation of the disadvantages of 'Banking style of Education'.
